 @file
 @brief Message for broadcasting CBNetworkAddresses over the network. This is used to share socket information for peers that are accepting incomming connections. When making an object, get the addresses you want to add and then set the "addrNum" and "addresses" fields. When managing the addresses you want to share, it's best to keep one object and change the addresses when necessary by reorganising the pointers with the "addresses" field. Inherits CBMessage
