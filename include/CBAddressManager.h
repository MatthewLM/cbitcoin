 @file
 @brief Stores addresses both unconnected and connected. It also proves serialisation and deserialisation so that addresses can be stored in binary format. Credit largely goes to the addrman.cpp code in the original client, although the code here has differences. Inherits CBMessage. The binary format contains a 32 bit integer for the cbitcoin version, followed by CB_BUCKET_NUM buckets. Each of these buckets is written as a 16 bit integer for the number of addresses and then the serialised CBNetworkAddresses one after the other. After the buckets is the 64 bit integer secret.
